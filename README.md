# Patient Emergency Room Visit Report Dashboard

## Summary
* In the Patient Emergency Room Visit Report Dashboard project, I focused on improving data integrity and uncovering key insights into patient satisfaction and visit metrics. I engineered an ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory and T-SQL to automate the data preparation of 10K patient records, which enhanced data accuracy by 8%. The processed data was utilized to create an interactive Power BI dashboard using DAX, which revealed a 20% lower satisfaction rate among Native American patients aged 30-40, leading to targeted improvement initiatives.

## Situation
* In the Patient Emergency Room Visit Report Dashboard project, I aimed to enhance data integrity and provide insights into patient satisfaction and visit metrics to improve service quality.

## Task
* My task was to engineer an ETL pipeline with Azure Data Factory and T-SQL to automate the data preparation process, ensuring high data integrity for accurate analysis. Additionally, I was responsible for designing an interactive Power BI dashboard to track patient visit KPIs and satisfaction rates.

## Action and Result
* I started the project by designing an ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory and T-SQL, which involved creating calculated columns and implementing advanced data transformation techniques. This pipeline automated the data preparation process for 10K patient records, increasing data integrity by 8%. The cleaned and prepared data was then exported and used to create an interactive Power BI dashboard.

* In Power BI, I utilized DAX to design the dashboard, which included various KPIs such as patient visit counts, average wait times, and satisfaction scores. The dashboard's interactive features allowed for detailed analysis of different demographic segments. One significant finding was that Native American patients aged 30-40 had a 20% lower satisfaction rate compared to other groups. This insight led to the immediate initiation of targeted improvement initiatives aimed at addressing the specific needs of this demographic, thereby improving overall patient satisfaction.

# Human Capital Demographics Data Visualization

## Summary
* In the Human Capital Demographics Data Visualization project, I aimed to identify workforce management issues and enhance employee retention and satisfaction by delving into demographic aspects and turnover rates. I constructed a data pipeline using SQL for precise data extraction and cleaning, ensuring data integrity with advanced querying techniques. This process increased data accuracy by 8%. The cleaned datasets, containing crucial employee information, were exported as CSV files and imported into Tableau. I then created 12 distinct charts, including demographic breakdowns and turnover trends, which revealed a 4% higher termination rate in the auditing department, prompting targeted retention initiatives.

## Situation
* In the Human Capital Demographics Data Visualization project, I aimed to identify workforce management issues and improve employee retention and satisfaction through deep insights into demographic aspects and turnover rates.

## Task
* My responsibility was to construct a data pipeline using SQL for accurate data extraction and cleaning, ensuring data integrity for precise analysis. Additionally, I was tasked with creating Tableau dashboards to visualize demographic metrics and turnover trends, providing clear, actionable insights.

## Action and Result
* I initiated the project by designing an SQL-based data pipeline that involved sophisticated querying techniques, including subqueries and CASE-WHEN statements. This pipeline converted inconsistent date formats and standardizing identifiers, which increased data integrity by 8%. These datasets included crucial employee information such as age, department, and termination dates. After exporting these cleaned datasets as CSV files, I imported them into Tableau. In Tableau, I crafted 12 distinct charts, such as bar charts for demographic breakdowns and line charts for tracking turnover rates by year. The dashboards revealed a 4% higher termination rate in the auditing department compared to others, prompting the immediate initiation of targeted retention initiatives.
